    This route allows navigation through a list of pages. Given the name of the current page,

    first one in the list, the function will loop back to the last page.

    Parameters:
    - current_page: The name of the current page, passed in the URL. This helps to determine
      the previous page in the sequence.

    Behavior:
    - If the current page is found in the 'pages' list:
        - The index of the current page is located.
        - The index of the previous page is calculated by decrementing the current index by 1.
