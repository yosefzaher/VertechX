class AutoMode:
    """
    AutoMode class that controls a set of pumps, valves, and LEDs based on sensor readings.
    It runs on a separate thread and continuously fetches data from a set of APIs.
    Based on the sensor readings, it makes decisions to turn on/off pumps, valves, and LEDs.

    Attributes:
        interval (int): Time interval in seconds between each cycle of data fetching and decision making.
        running (bool): A flag that indicates whether the Auto Mode is currently running.
        thread (threading.Thread): The thread that runs the Auto Mode's logic in the background.

    Methods:
        start(): Starts the Auto Mode in a separate thread.
        stop(): Stops the Auto Mode and resets the counter.
        run(): The main loop of the Auto Mode that fetches data and makes decisions.
        control_pump(pump_num, state): Controls a specified pump by sending a POST request to the API.
        control_valves(valve_num, state): Controls a specified valve by sending a POST request to the API.
        control_led(state): Controls the LED state by sending a POST request to the API.
